# Bike-Share Capstone Project

This project was completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Certificate** on Coursera.

## 📊 Objective
Analyze ride data from a fictional bike-share company to identify user behavior patterns and provide actionable business insights that support marketing and operational decision-making.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Casual riders tend to take longer rides and prefer weekends, while annual members use bikes more frequently on weekdays.
- Clear behavioral differences support the need for segmented marketing campaigns.
- Operational optimizations can be made by aligning bike availability with demand patterns.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- R (RStudio): data wrangling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- Excel: preliminary exploration and structure
- ggplot2, dplyr: for visualizations and data manipulation

## 📈 Deliverables
- Cleaned and transformed datasets (sample)
- Final analysis report
- Visualizations showing ride trends by user type, day, and duration

## 📂 Files

- `cleaned_data.csv`: Cleaned sample dataset
- `r_script.R`: Main R script used for transformation and analysis
